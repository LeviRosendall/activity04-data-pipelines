In this activity I learned how do use pipelines to streamline my code and to make it more readable. I am comfortable with the idea of piping my code. It makes it
easier for me to make display changes to a dataset, as opposed to having to include 'data=' in every step. I am still getting comfortable with the different
functions in dplyr, but they are starting to make sense. I think I would benefit from brushing up on the different operators, for example %in%. I had to look some of
those up to remember what they did and how they were syntaxed.
